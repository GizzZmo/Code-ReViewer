# Environment Configuration Template

# NOTE: As of the latest version, API keys are configured at runtime in the browser UI
# and no longer need to be set as environment variables for building the application.

# This file is kept for reference and backwards compatibility.

# Gemini API Configuration
# DEPRECATED: API keys are now configured in the browser UI
# GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here

# Application Configuration
NODE_ENV=development

# Optional: Custom API endpoint (if using proxy)
# API_ENDPOINT=https://your-proxy.com/api

# Optional: Enable debug mode
# DEBUG=true

# Instructions:
# 1. Users should configure their API key directly in the application UI
# 2. The API key is stored securely in the browser's localStorage
# 3. No environment variables are needed for the API key anymore
